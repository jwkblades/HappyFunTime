Random thoughts that I found interesting enough to publish.

Item Generator
--------------

A very simple iteration based item generator for table top RPGs (such as
dungeons and dragons).

This requires the [DOM](https://github.com/jwkblades/DOM) library I wrote years ago.


Twitch?
=======

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
by! [My Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/betawar1305).
